# Examples
CtrlAer comes with several example programs demonstrating different use cases and features:

## [Stepper motor control](stepper.md)

A simple example showing how to control a stepper motor by generating two alternating phases. Demonstrates:
- Basic signal generation
- Phase control

## [Ultrasonic control](ultrasonic.md)

An example showing how to generate ultrasonic pulses with precise timing and simultaneous high-frequency and low-frequency generation.

## [Blocking operations](blocking.md)

A more complex example showing how to coordinate multiple operations with precise timing. Demonstrates:
- Non-blocking operation
- External pin control
- Variable timing patterns
- Program coordination
